#### FORMS Lab Repository

Welcome to the FORMS Lab Repository! This repository serves as a standardized starting point for doing research in asset allocation. It contains a SQLite database of financial data and an interactive Jupyter notebook for doing backtesting analysis. 

There are many other backtesting frameworks out there. However, they change frequently and contain too many bells and whistles. 


#### Repository Contents

1. Database: The financial_db.db SQLite database. This database encompasses a wide array of financial metrics, including stock prices, fundamentals, and more

2. images: backtesting visual outputs go here

3. Resources: In the resources directory, you'll see some info on Wharton Research Data Services

4. services: The services directory contains some helper functions relating to pulling the data, estimation, and optimization

5. flat_files: If the database is too much work to deal with then there are some csv files containing factor returns and asset prices.

6. Template_Main.ipynb: a notebook illustrating the backtesting procedure. Calling from the database, defining a strategy, and testing it
7. MIE377_Project_Main.ipynb: a notebook illustrating the backtesting procedure. Reading the flat files, defining the project function and testing it. 

#### Get Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Download the SQLite database/follow the notebooks to construct the database locally
3. Save the database to the Database\ folder
4. Go to cvxpy website and follow the prerequisite instructions for cvxpy (C++ build tools are required for cvxpy)
5. Create the environment: conda env create -f environment.yml
